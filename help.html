            This webpage essentially permits you to investigate how character connections played a role in Romeo and Juliet. 
            Specifically, you get to set connections between characters as integer numbers, and see how over/under dependence between these characters' consequences
            have been represented in the text. To use this webpage, there are some basic instructions: 
            
            <br> <br><br> 

            1. You begin by selecting all the characters you want to investigate. If you want to investigate the system of Romeo, Juliet, Nurse, and Capulet, then you choose them. 
            <br><br>
            2. You then fill out the connections between each character. You may make this a one-way connection (such as Juliet's connection towards the Nurse different from the Nurse's connection towards Juliet) or a dual connection. 
            To enter the information, in each box type "[Character Name]:[Weight of connection]" with spaces between consecutive connections. 
            <br><br> 
            3. Once the connections are filled out, you will receive a pop-up asking you to choose which two characters you want to find the connection between. If you want to investigate
            Romeo and Juliet, simply type "Romeo Juliet", with a space seperating them. 
            <br> <br> 
            4. You are then presented with a graph where the shortest path between the two characters are highlighted in red.
